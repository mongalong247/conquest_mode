# conquest_mode
Base Game Variant of Conquest Mode for Wikinger: European Theater of War

In it's current state it is all but complete, there is only one known issue.

Known Issue: sWS Trucks required_not / required_sector_type / sector_type_victory - to correct this will potentially make this game mode incompatible with all tuning packs, for now it will remain this way.

Future Development: Once it has been pushed out to the community.
Looking at game length will be addressed by adjusting the number of tickets in each mode.
Possibly having "dynamic tickets" where the game will calculate map size and number of players and adjust the number of tickets - therefore it will be a "short/medium/long" game rather than set tickets
